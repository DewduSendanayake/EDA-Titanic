# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, aiming to identify the key factors that influenced passenger survival during the historical maritime disaster. The dataset, originally made available through Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition, serves as a widely recognized benchmark for binary classification and data analysis tasks.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to examine the dataset through descriptive statistics and visual analytics in order to:

* Understand the structure and composition of the data.
* Identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations between variables.
* Explore the impact of demographic and socioeconomic factors such as gender, passenger class, and age on survival likelihood.

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis is conducted using Python and the following data science libraries:

* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: As the interactive development environment.

## Key Analyses Performed

* Distribution of survival across various features (e.g., gender, passenger class, age).
* Visualization of missing data and handling of null values.
* Correlation matrix and heatmap to evaluate relationships between numerical variables.
* Creation of new derived features to enhance insight (e.g., family status).

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

* **PassengerId**
* **Survived** (target variable)
* **Pclass** (ticket class)
* **Name, Sex, Age**
* **SibSp, Parch** (family relations aboard)
* **Ticket, Fare**
* **Cabin, Embarked** (port of embarkation)

## Conclusion

This EDA reveals meaningful patterns within the Titanic dataset, especially highlighting the survival advantage associated with female passengers, higher-class tickets, and younger age groups. These insights not only help understand the dataset better but also lay the groundwork for potential machine learning applications.
